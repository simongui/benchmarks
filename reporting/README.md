# Reporting
This directory contains the R scripts that generate the benchmark reports.

# Generating reports
You can see examples of how the reports are generated in the `Makefile` using R scripts. You can find some sample result files in `results/samples`.

```
Rscript plotting/gobench_multi_nsop.r ./results/samples/hashing.log ./results/hashing-multi.png
```
